"Copy as HTML" for Brackets
==============================
Copy code to the clipboard with full color syntax highlighting preserved (assuming you're pasting into something that
supports HTML-formatted text, such as Outlook or GMail). Works with any language Brackets supports.

To use, choose _Edit > Copy as Colored HTML_.  Due to runtime limitations, you still must explicitly press Ctrl+C on the next
screen to place the text onto the clipboard.

If you have some text selected, you'll get just that text. If you have no selection, you'll get the entire file.
